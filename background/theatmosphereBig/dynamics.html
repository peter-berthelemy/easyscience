<p>
    Atmospheric dynamics just means how the atmosphere moves. This is mainly down to some pretty simple thermodynamics and some of Newton's laws.
    For example, the winds only occur because the Sun heats the Earth irregularly (because the Earth spins).
    As the warmth from the Sun heats the atmosphere, the air in that area rises, leaving an area of low pressure.
    The low pressure area tries to even itself out too, so more air rushes into the gap left.

    There are convective cells (Hadley etc) around the world.
    Some of this is because of the Coriolis effect.

    Maybe could talk about things like ENSO and SSWs (NAO?)

    Talk about planetary waves
