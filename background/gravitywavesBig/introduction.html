<p>
    Atmospheric gravity waves are ways that the atmosphere tries to make itself even.
    They are the main way the atmosphere moves energy up and down
    Where they break (like in the water), they release the energy as turbulence.
    This slows down, or speeds up, the wind where they break (like trying to go into a breaking wave, or riding a breaking wave).
